        <p id="dishonored" class="standfirst">Set in the plague-ravaged city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano, the last bodyguard to Empress Jessamine Kaldwin. Framed for her murder and the abduction of her daughter, Emily, Corvo is falsely imprisoned by the Empress' Royal Spymaster and usurper, Hiram Burrows.
        <br/><br/>Corvo takes on the role of a feared and infamous assassin as he pursues members of the coup one by one.</p>


        <p id="dishonored2" class="standfirst">After an "otherworldly usurper" steals the throne from the Empress, she and Corvo Attano must travel to the city of Karnaca in search of the key that will restore her to power.
        <br/><br/>Also returning is the mysterious black-eyed deity known as the Outsider, who plays a pivotal role in conveying the story and progressing the plot in the game through dialogue and cutscenes.</p>

        <p id="dishonoreddoo" class="standfirst">Set a couple of months after the end of Dishonored 2, Billie Lurk returns to Karnaca to reunite with her mentor, the legendary assassin Daud. Together, they will explore the dark underbelly of the city to recover artifacts in order to kill the source of chaos within the Empire, the Outsider himself.
        <br/><br/>The story will delve more into the Outsider's past and the reason for his existence.</p>
